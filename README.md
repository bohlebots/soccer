# Bohlebots
<h2>collection of all published and open source software and hardware from the Bohlebots.</h2>
We are a team of students at the Gymnasium Haan in Germany. We call ourselves Bohlebots
due to the support of the Bohle company at our home town Haan.

We decided to put all our robotic stuff opensource. This includes arduino files and libraries,
eagle pcb files () and eagle libraries (lbr) for all our baords.
